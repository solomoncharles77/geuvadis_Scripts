1    	phe_id | grp_id	The phenotype ID or if one of the grouping options is provided, then phenotype group ID
2    	phe_chr	The phenotype chromosome
3    	phe_from	Start position of the phenotype
4    	phe_to	End position of the phenotype
5    	phe_strd	The phenotype strand
5.1    	phe_id | ve_by_pc1 | n_phe_in_grp	Only printed if --group-best | --group-pca1 | --group-mean. The phenotype ID, variance explained by PC1, or number of phenotypes in the phenotype group for --group-best, --group-pca1, and --group-mean, respectively.
5.2    	n_phe_in_grp	Only printed if --group-pca1 | --group-mean. The number of phenotypes in the phenotype group.
6    	n_var_in_cis	The number variants in the cis window for this phenotype.
7    	dist_phe_var	The distance between the variant and the phenotype start positions.
8    	var_id	The most significant variant ID.
9    	var_chr	The most significant variant's chromosome.
10    	var_from	The start position of the most significant variant.
11    	var_to	The end position of the most significant variant.
12    	rank	The rank of the association. This tells you if the variant has been mapped as belonging to the best signal (rank=0), the second best (rank=1), etc ... As a consequence, the maximum rank value for a given phenotype tells you how many independent signals there are (e.g. rank=2 means 3 independent signals).
13    	fwd_pval	The nominal forward p-value of the association between the most significant variant and the phenotype.
14    	fwd_r_squared	The r squared of the forward linear regression.
15    	fwd_slope	The beta (slope) of the forward linear regression.
15.1    	fwd_slope_se	The standard error of the forward beta. Only printed if --std-err is provided.
16    	fwd_best_hit	Whether or not this variant was the forward most significant variant.
17    	fwd_sig	Whether this variant was significant. Currently all variants are significant so this is redundant.
18    	bwd_pval	The nominal backward p-value of the association between the most significant variant and the phenotype.
19    	bwd_r_squared	The r squared of the backward linear regression.
20    	bwd_slope	The beta (slope) of the backward linear regression.
20.1    	bwd_slope_se	The standard error of the backward beta. Only printed if --std-err is provided.
21    	bwd_best_hit	Whether or not this variant was the backward most significant variant.
22    	bwd_sig	Whether this variant was significant. Currently all variants are significant so this is redundant.
